# TypeScript Exercises

Practicing TypeScript and TypeScript Notes

## Notes

Built on top of JavaScript (add static typing, code completion, refactoring, shorthand notations)

Statically-Typed Languages (C++, C#, Java)
int num = 10; will always be number
num = "a"; won't work

let x: number = 10;

Drawbacks:
Transpilation/Compilation step
Strictness
